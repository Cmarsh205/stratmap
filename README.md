**StratMap** is an interactive strategy planner for Rainbow Six Siege. It allows players to visually create, save, and share tactical plans for any map. Think of it as a digital whiteboard for planning operator positions, objective locations, and team strategies.

## Motivation

Gaming has been a huge part of my life for as long as I can remember, one of my favourite series being the Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six games. I have played a lot of Siege in particular and have always wanted to be more competitive like the game was designed to be. So when starting this project I knew I wanted it gaming focused and helpful to my friends, the public, and I. This is what I landed on, a tool that can help bring your teammates together and form a competitive strategy to use in your games.
